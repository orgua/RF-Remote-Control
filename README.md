# RF-Remote-Control
Programs to control/repeat/receive Commands for UAV/Quadrotor and eSkateboard (comes without Libs). Codebase of the systems is very similar. 

You need the following things: 
- an Atmel-MCU / Arduino / JeeNode or my ArduNode (schematics in basedir)
- an RFM12 or RF95 rf-transceiver
- Libs: iLib (MyRepo), Radiohead (Airspayce) or JeeLib (JCW) for rfm95 or rf95
