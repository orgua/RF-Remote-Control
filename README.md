# RF-Remote-Control
Programs to control/repeat/receive Commands for UAV/Quadrotor and eSkateboard (comes without Libs). Codebase of the different systems is very similar. I use the programs with my small 15x22mm ArduNode (schematics *.pdf in basedir) which come with a rf-transceiver on their back.

You need the following things: 
- an Atmel-MCU / Arduino / JeeNode or ArduNode 
- an RFM12 or RF95 rf-transceiver
- Libs: iLib (MyRepo), Radiohead (Airspayce) or JeeLib (JCW) for rfm95 or rf95
